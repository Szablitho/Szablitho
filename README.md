### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My real name is Wiktor Szablewski. I'm currently applying for job offers. I have not so much time to code. However, in near future I will learn React to speed up and specialize myself in Frontend Development deeper. Check out my Tic-Tac-Toe game or Travel Page to see the most recent project.
